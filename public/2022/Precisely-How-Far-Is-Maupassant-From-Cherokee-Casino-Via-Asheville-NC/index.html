<h1 id="How-Far-Is-Maupassant-From-Cherokee-Casino-Via-Asheville-NC"><a href="#How-Far-Is-Maupassant-From-Cherokee-Casino-Via-Asheville-NC" class="headerlink" title="How Far Is Maupassant From Cherokee Casino Via Asheville NC?"></a>How Far Is Maupassant From Cherokee Casino Via Asheville NC?</h1><p>The celebrated French author, Guy de Maupassant, was born in Normandy in 1850 and died of a stroke in Paris in 1893. He is considered one of the fathers of the modern short story. It’s said that he could dash off a story in minutes.</p>
<p>Maupassant spent considerable time in his youth at his uncle’s home near Rouen. His maternal grandfather was an owner of a large hotel in Trouville-sur-Mer on the Normandy coast and Maupassant often stayed with him during the summer. So it’s no surprise that some of his better-known works are set in Normandy, including “Boule de suif” (1880), “Madame Bovary” (1857) and “Pierre et Jean” (1888).</p>
<p>While Maupassant never traveled to America, he was familiar with its literature, especially that of Mark Twain. Maupassant was impressed by Twain’s ability to describe seemingly commonplace things in ways that revealed their underlying strangeness or humor.</p>
<p>One of Twain’s books, “Roughing It,” tells the humorous story of a group of easterners who travel west to join the California gold rush. The group includes Twain’s brother, Orion Clemens, who served as secretary to Governor Leland Stanford and later became United States Superintendent of Indian Affairs.</p>
<p>Clemens had learned about the Cherokee people while serving as secretary to the governor and was interested in their prospects as Native Americans were being pushed out of their traditional lands east of the Mississippi River. In 1873 he traveled to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) as part of a delegation sent by the federal government to investigate conditions among the Cherokee people.</p>
<p>While there Clemens met John Ross, who had been Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation since 1828 and who was nearly 80 years old at the time. Ross had been one of the leaders of the Cherokee Nation during removal along the Trail of Tears and was well-acquainted with United States officials negotiating for Cherokee land. Ross told Clemens about an agreement he had negotiated with Ulysses S. Grant allowing some Cherokees to remain on their lands in present-day Arkansas.</p>
<p>Clemens also visited Sequoyah’s home near Sallisaw, where he saw and photographed Sequoyah’s alphabetical syllabary for writing Cherokee (see image at right). After returning east, Clemens wrote about his experiences among the Cherokee for Harper’s Weekly. In 1875 he published them as a book called “The Life on the plains; or sketches thereof.”</p>
<p>Guy de Maupassant would have been very interested in reading Clemens’ book about life on the American frontier given his own interest in discovering new frontiers – both physical and literary. If they ever met, they would doubtless have had much to discuss about America – its people, landscape and literature</p>
