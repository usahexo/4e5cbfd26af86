The game is played with two or more players. One player is chosen to be the prince, and the others are princes or princesses. The prince lays down a number of bedding items (blankets, towels, sheets, etc.), and then hides a pea under one of them. The other players try to find the pea by feeling each of the bedding items.</p>
<p>The player who finds the pea is declared the princess, and must guess who hid it. If she guesses correctly, that player becomes the new prince; if she guesses incorrectly, she must take her place among the other players.</p>

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, right? A story that takes place in the fairytale kingdom of Croatia.</p>
<p>At first glance, it may not seem like there is a lot of connection between Croatia and the poisoned apple game. But if you look a little closer, you’ll see that there are actually a few interesting ties between the two.</p>
<p>For starters, the story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was actually based on a real Croatian queen named Jelena. Jelena was known for her beauty and her charm, much like Snow White in the story. She also had a tragic ending, just like Snow White.</p>
<p>In addition to that, many of the scenes from the movie were filmed in Croatia. You can visit some of those filming locations today and see for yourself how beautiful they are.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for an interesting travel destination with a bit of historical significance, Croatia is definitely worth checking out. And don’t forget to try some of the delicious apple cider while you’re there!</p>

To play, each player takes turns selecting an apple from a bowl. The player who selects the poisoned apple is out of the game. The last player left in the game is the winner.</p>
<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when playing the Poisoned Apple Game. First, make sure all of the apples are different colors so players can easily identify them. Second, make sure there is one poisoned apple in the bowl. If there are multiple poisoned apples, then it becomes more difficult to determine who has selected the poison apple. Finally, if you are playing with younger children, make sure they know not to take bites of any of the apples.</p>
