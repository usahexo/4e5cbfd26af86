        <h1 id="Cavs-Playing-Easy-Game-Tonight-Means-Early-Jackpot"><a href="#Cavs-Playing-Easy-Game-Tonight-Means-Early-Jackpot" class="headerlink" title="Cavs Playing Easy Game Tonight Means Early Jackpot"></a>Cavs Playing Easy Game Tonight Means Early Jackpot</h1><p>The Cleveland Cavaliers have a really easy game against the Atlanta Hawks tonight. This is great news if you’re looking to make an early jackpot in NBA betting.</p>
<p>The Cavs are currently a 14-point favorite, and although this line might change before tip-off, it’s a safe bet that Cleveland will come out on top. The Hawks have been struggling all season long, and there’s no reason to believe they’ll be able to take down the Cavs tonight.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for some quick action tonight, then putting your money on the Cavs is a safe bet. LeBron James and company should have no trouble dispatching of the Hawks, and you can expect them to cover the spread with ease. So don’t miss out on this early jackpot – put your money on the Cavs and walk away with some easy profits!</p>
<h1 id="3-0-and-You’re-In-Cavs-Get-Another-Shot-at-Easy-Jackpot"><a href="#3-0-and-You’re-In-Cavs-Get-Another-Shot-at-Easy-Jackpot" class="headerlink" title="3-0 and You’re In: Cavs Get Another Shot at Easy Jackpot"></a>3-0 and You’re In: Cavs Get Another Shot at Easy Jackpot</h1><p>The Cleveland Cavaliers have their sights set on the NBA Finals for a fourth consecutive season, and they got one step closer with a dominant first-round sweep of the Indiana Pacers. LeBron James is playing some of the best basketball of his career, and now the Cavs will face the Toronto Raptors in the second round.</p>
<p>The Raptors finished the season with the best record in the Eastern Conference, but they’re not a team that will give Cleveland much trouble. The Cavs should be able to win this series easily, and they’ll likely be heavily favored against whoever emerges from the Boston Celtics- Milwaukee Bucks series.</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine anyone beating Cleveland in a seven-game series right now. The Cavs are clicking on all cylinders, and they seem unstoppable. If they can stay healthy and continue to play at this level, they’ll be hoisting their fourth championship trophy in June.</p>
<h1 id="Averaging-Over-100-Points-Per-Game-Lands-Cavs-an-Easy-Jackpot"><a href="#Averaging-Over-100-Points-Per-Game-Lands-Cavs-an-Easy-Jackpot" class="headerlink" title="Averaging Over 100 Points Per Game Lands Cavs an Easy Jackpot"></a>Averaging Over 100 Points Per Game Lands Cavs an Easy Jackpot</h1><p>LeBron James and his Cleveland Cavaliers teammates are in the process of a historical season, with averages over 100 points per game. As a result, the team is raking in the wins and the money.</p>
<p>This year has seen an increase in the NBA’s salary cap, due to the new television deal that was signed last year. The $24 billion agreement will provide each team with roughly $100 million annually for the next nine years. This has led to outrageous contracts being given out this offseason, including one to LeBron James himself.</p>
<p>James signed a three-year deal worth $100 million, with an opt-out after the second year. In addition to his salary from the Cavs, he will also make approximately $30 million from endorsements and other business ventures. So far this season, LeBron is averaging 27 points, 10 assists, and 8 rebounds per game. This puts him on track for another MVP award and another trip to the Finals.</p>
<p>The increased salary cap has also allowed teams like the Oklahoma City Thunder to keep their star players. Kevin Durant re-signed with OKC for two years and $54 million, despite heavy interest from other teams. With new contracts like this being handed out regularly, it is clear that the NBA is booming financially.</p>
<p>The Cavaliers have already locked up a spot in the playoffs, but they are still fighting for first place in their division. They currently sit in second place behind the Golden State Warriors. If they can maintain their high level of play and win the championship, it is likely that they will receive a payout in excess of $100 million.</p>
<p>It is safe to say that LeBron James and his team are winning both on and off of the court this year. The Cavs are taking home boatloads of cash while putting on one of the most exciting spectacles in all of sports.</p>
<h1 id="Easiest-Way-to-Win-a-Jackpot-Bet-on-the-Cavaliers"><a href="#Easiest-Way-to-Win-a-Jackpot-Bet-on-the-Cavaliers" class="headerlink" title="Easiest Way to Win a Jackpot: Bet on the Cavaliers"></a>Easiest Way to Win a Jackpot: Bet on the Cavaliers</h1><p>The Cleveland Cavaliers have been on a tear this season, and they show no signs of slowing down. This makes them the obvious choice for your next jackpot bet.</p>
<p>The Cavs have been particularly impressive in their last few games. They demolished the Atlanta Hawks by a score of 126-77, and then followed that up with an impressive win over the Boston Celtics. Kyrie Irving was particularly impressive against Boston, scoring 38 points on 14-of-20 shooting.</p>
<p>Irving is one of the most dynamic players in the NBA, and he has been playing at an MVP-level this season. He is supported by a deep and talented roster that includes players like LeBron James, Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson, and J.R. Smith. This team is capable of beating anyone in the league when they are playing at their best.</p>
<p>When you add all of this up, it’s easy to see why the Cleveland Cavaliers are such a good choice for your next jackpot bet. They are arguably the best team in the NBA right now, and they have a history of performing well in the playoffs. So make sure to include them in your next betting pool – you won’t regret it.</p>
<h1 id="Cavs’-Effortless-Play-Nets-Another-Jackpot"><a href="#Cavs’-Effortless-Play-Nets-Another-Jackpot" class="headerlink" title="Cavs’ Effortless Play Nets Another Jackpot"></a>Cavs’ Effortless Play Nets Another Jackpot</h1><p>The Cleveland Cavaliers continue to amaze everyone with their easy and effortless play, scoring over 120 points in their last three games. The latest victim was the Washington Wizards, who had no answer for LeBron James and company.</p>
<p>James led all scorers with 27 points, while Kyrie Irving added 24 and Kevin Love had 21. The Cavs shot 53 percent from the field, including 10-of-25 from behind the arc. They also forced 23 turnovers and outrebounded Washington by eight.</p>
<p>The Wizards were led by John Wall’s 19 points, but he was hampered by foul trouble and only played 28 minutes. Bradley Beal had 15 points on 5-of-14 shooting and Otto Porter Jr. added 14 off the bench.</p>
<p>Washington actually took a six-point lead early in the third quarter, but Cleveland went on a 17-4 run to take control of the game. The Cavs never looked back, cruising to an easy victory.</p>
<p>“We’re just playing free,” Irving said after the game. “We’re not trying to do too much. We’re just making the simple plays and enjoying playing with one another.”</p>
<p>It’s certainly been a different story since Isaiah Thomas returned from injury two games ago. With Thomas on the floor, James has been able to move back to his natural small forward position, which has made life easier for everyone else. Irving is shooting better than 50 percent from the field in those two games, while Love is averaging 23 points and 11 rebounds.</p>
<p>“We know that we have so many weapons on this team,” James said. “When one guy is not going well or somebody is struggling, we can just go to another guy.”</p>
<p>There’s little doubt that the Cavs are still the team to beat in the Eastern Conference, even without Thomas (who remains sidelined with a hip injury). They’ve now won seven consecutive games and seem poised to make another deep playoff run.</p>
