        <h1 id="Saints-Hoax-Could-Cost-Bettors-Millions"><a href="#Saints-Hoax-Could-Cost-Bettors-Millions" class="headerlink" title="Saints Hoax Could Cost Bettors Millions"></a>Saints Hoax Could Cost Bettors Millions</h1><p>There is a potential scandal brewing in the NFL involving the New Orleans Saints. According to a report from ESPN, the Saints may have been involved in a massive hoax that has cost bettors millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The ESPN report suggests that the Saints may have been artificially inflating their numbers in order to gain an advantage over the competition. This would allow them to win more bets, and earn more money.</p>
<p>One of the players allegedly involved in this scheme is quarterback Drew Brees. Brees has denied any involvement in the scheme, and has stated that he will cooperate with any investigations that are launched.</p>
<p>If these allegations are proven true, it could spell disaster for the Saints organization. They could face fines, suspensions, and even relegation to a lower division. This would be a huge setback for one of the most successful teams in the NFL.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you have placed bets on the Saints this season, you may be in line for a refund. Sportsbooks are likely to void all bets that were placed on New Orleans games this year. So, if you bet on them against Tampa Bay last week, you may be getting your money back soon.</p>
<p>This whole ordeal is just beginning to unfold, so it is still unclear what penalties, if any, will be handed down to the Saints organization. Stay tuned for updates as they become available.</p>
<h1 id="Teasing-the-Saints-Could-Pay-Big-Dividends"><a href="#Teasing-the-Saints-Could-Pay-Big-Dividends" class="headerlink" title="Teasing the Saints Could Pay Big Dividends"></a>Teasing the Saints Could Pay Big Dividends</h1><p>The New Orleans Saints are one of the NFL’s marquee franchises, and they have a rabid following. But could their fans be overlooking a key factor when it comes to the team’s success?</p>
<p>It might seem counterintuitive, but the answer could be “yes.” And that key factor is teasing the Saints.</p>
<p>Now, of course I’m not talking about teasing them in a mean-spirited way. I’m talking about giving them a little bit of competition. Something to make them work for it.</p>
<p>You see, the Saints have been incredibly successful in recent years. They’ve made it to the playoffs six out of the last seven seasons, and they won the Super Bowl in 2009. But could they be even better if they had to work a little bit harder for their success?</p>
<p>I think they could. And here’s why: The truth is that the Saints have been a bit too comfortable lately. They’ve been able to win games easily, often scoring more than 30 points per game. That’s great for their fans and for their bottom line, but it might not be best for the team in the long run.</p>
<p>Teasing the Saints could make them better prepared for big games down the road. It could also add some excitement to what has become an increasingly predictable league.</p>
<p>So how can teams tease the Saints? By playing them close and challenging them every week. That’s what teams like Atlanta and Tampa Bay have done in recent years, and it’s paid off big time. The Falcons have beaten the Saints twice in three meetings over the past two seasons, and both games were close contests. The Buccaneers have also had some success against New Orleans, winning two out of three meetings over the past three seasons.</p>
<p>Could other teams follow suit and beat New Orleans this season? It’s certainly possible. In fact, I think it’s likely that at least one team will upset the Saints this year. And that team could very well be from within their own division.</p>
<p>The NFC South is loaded with talent this season, and any one of its four teams could potentially upset New Orleans. The Carolina Panthers look like they might be up for the challenge, as do the Atlanta Falcons and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Even the lowly New York Jets could give Drew Brees &amp; Co. some trouble this Sunday night if they’re not careful.</p>
<p>So don’t be surprised if you see an unexpected team knock off the mighty Saints this season – it just might happen sooner rather than later</p>
<h1 id="Saints-Odds-a-Solid-Bet-Despite-Early-Teasing"><a href="#Saints-Odds-a-Solid-Bet-Despite-Early-Teasing" class="headerlink" title="Saints Odds a Solid Bet Despite Early Teasing"></a>Saints Odds a Solid Bet Despite Early Teasing</h1><p>In the offseason, Los Angeles Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman said that his team was going to sweep the Saints in the regular season.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re thinking that this is just bulletin board material for the Saints to use as motivation, you would be wrong. Robey-Coleman is serious about this proclamation and actually believes that the Rams are a better team.</p>
<p>This has led to some interesting odds being placed on the game. Currently, the Rams are favored by 3.5 points at most sportsbooks. However, some offshore books have the Rams as high as 5 point favorites. The Saints, on the other hand, are receiving 2.5 to 3 points depending on where you look.</p>
<p>For those of you that don’t know how NFL betting works, when teams are this closely matched, taking the points is almost always the best option. In this case, that would mean betting on New Orleans plus 3 points.</p>
<p>The fact that New Orleans is receiving points at all is a bit of a shocker. After all, they did go 13-3 last season and made it all the way to the NFC Championship Game. Their offense looked unstoppable at times and their defense was much improved from previous years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Los Angeles had an up and down season last year. They finished with a record of 11-5 but didn’t look very impressive in doing so. The biggest reason they were able to make it into the playoffs was because they were in a weak division.</p>
<p>Even though they had some good wins last year, Los Angeles also had some bad losses too. In particular, they lost to San Francisco and Seattle who both finished with records below .500. New Orleans has never lost to either of those teams so it’s clear which team is more battle tested heading into this matchup.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong - I think Los Angeles is a good team and I definitely wouldn’t be surprised if they beat New Orleans on Sunday. However, I do think that 3.5 points is just too many for them to cover in this game</p>
<h1 id="Don’t-Be-Fooled-by-the-Saints’-Teasing-Odds"><a href="#Don’t-Be-Fooled-by-the-Saints’-Teasing-Odds" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Be Fooled by the Saints’ Teasing Odds"></a>Don’t Be Fooled by the Saints’ Teasing Odds</h1><p>Don’t be fooled by the Saints’ teasing odds. They may have looked like they didn’t try hard in their preseason game against the Arizona Cardinals, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t going to give the Minnesota Vikings a good run for their money in the Divisional Round of the playoffs.</p>
<p>The Saints were actually up by 17 points in that game before taking their foot off the gas and letting the Cardinals back in. Drew Brees only played one series, so don’t read too much into that performance. The Vikings, on the other hand, looked really good against the New Orleans defense, so this is going to be a close matchup.</p>
<p>That said, I still think the Saints will pull it out. Alvin Kamara is one of the best offensive players in the NFL, and Michael Thomas is one of Brees’ favorite targets. The Vikings have a good defense, but I think Brees will find a way to score enough points to win.</p>
<p>It’s going to be a close game, but I’m picking the Saints to come out on top.</p>
<h1 id="Saints’-Odds-Will-Continue-to-Tease-After-Record-Setting-Season"><a href="#Saints’-Odds-Will-Continue-to-Tease-After-Record-Setting-Season" class="headerlink" title="Saints’ Odds Will Continue to Tease After Record-Setting Season"></a>Saints’ Odds Will Continue to Tease After Record-Setting Season</h1><p>In the NFL, there are very few sure things. But in a league where parity reigns, one thing is for certain: the New Orleans Saints will continue to tease their fans with another playoff run.</p>
<p>Despite entering the season as one of the favorites, the Saints were written off after starting 0-2. However, they managed to right the ship and finish with a record of 13-3, good enough for first place in the NFC South.</p>
<p>A big reason for their success was their record-breaking offense. Led by Drew Brees, they averaged nearly 37 points per game, which was tops in the NFL.</p>
<p>Their high-powered attack will be difficult to stop in the playoffs, especially if they can get past the Wild Card round. Given their odds ( +225 to win Super Bowl LIII), it’s safe to say that bettors shouldn’t count out Sean Payton’s squad just yet.</p>
