#  Michigan set to join a select few states with legal sports gambling

Michigan is set to join Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware, and West Virginia as the only states where sports gambling is legal. The bill was passed by the Michigan state legislature in late June and was awaiting the signature of Governor Rick Snyder.

Governor Snyder signed the bill into law on July 31, making Michigan the sixth state to allow some form of sports gambling. The new law allows betting on professional and collegiate sporting events, including baseball, basketball, football, hockey, and soccer. It does not allow bets on college games taking place in Michigan.

The move is seen as a way to bring more revenue to the state. A study by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming found that if Michigan legalized sports gambling and taxed it at 15%, it could generate up to $156 million in annual revenue. That would be a significant increase over the $5 million the state currently generates from lottery ticket sales.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to increased addiction and crime rates. They also argue that it will damage the integrity of sporting events. Supporters argue that regulated sports gambling will help protect consumers and generate much-needed revenue for the state.

Michigan is not the only state considering legalizing sports gambling. Legislation has been proposed in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma,, Pennsylvania,, Rhode Island,, South Carolina,, Tennessee,, Texas,, Utah,, Vermont,, Virginia,, Washington,, West Virginia,, Wisconsin,, Wyoming.

#  Monmouth Park Racetrack in New Jersey first in line for mobile sports betting

Just in time for the start of the NFL season, Monmouth Park Racetrack in New Jersey looks like it will be the first to offer mobile sports betting.

According to state officials, the racetrack has completed its application process and is now waiting for the go-ahead from Gov. Phil Murphy.

The track has plans to offer wagers not only on NFL games but also college football, basketball and other sports.

Murphy has said he's in favor of legalizing sports betting but wants to make sure that there are measures in place to protect consumers and that taxes generated will go towards enforcement and other initiatives.

A vote on a bill that would legalize sports betting is expected next month.

"It's great news for Monmouth Park and for Atlantic City," said Dennis Drazin, chairman and CEO of Darby Development LLC, which operates Monmouth Park. "We're excited to get started as soon as we possibly can."

#  Gaming control board approves regulations for sports betting

The Nevada Gaming Control Board has approved regulations for the sports betting industry in the state. This follows the US Supreme Court ruling in May which struck down a ban on sports betting outside of Nevada.

Under the new regulations, bookmakers will be able to offer bets on sporting events both at physical venues and online. However, they will not be able to take wagers on college sports.

The regulations were approved by the Board unanimously, with some conditions. These include that bookmakers must use geolocation technology to verify that customers are within Nevada borders, and that all bets must be placed in person, rather than online or over the phone.

Nevada is seen as a key market for sports betting, given its long history of legal gambling. The state is expected to generate over $100 million in revenue from sports betting in its first year alone. Other states are also planning to develop their own regulations for the industry following the Supreme Court ruling.

#  Michigan lawmakers considering legalizing sports betting

Michigan lawmakers are considering legalizing sports betting in the state.

The move comes as many other states have legalized sports betting in recent years, following a Supreme Court decision last year that allowed for such betting to take place.

Michigan lawmakers say that the potential revenue from legalized sports betting could be used to help fund education in the state.

“We believe there is an opportunity to generate new revenue for our schools, and ultimately create jobs, through the legalization of sports betting,” said State Senator Curtis Hertel Jr., a Democrat from East Lansing.

Opponents of legalized sports betting say that it could lead to increased addiction and gambling problems. They also argue that it could have a negative impact on the integrity of sporting events.

Legalized sports betting is currently available in 32 states, including Nevada which has long been known for its legal sports gambling.

#  Detroit casinos ready to offer sports betting

Michigan's three Detroit-area casinos have announced they are ready to offer sports betting as soon as the state allows it.

Detroit's MGM Grand, Greektown Casino and MotorCity Casino said they have been working on their sports betting offerings for more than a year and are prepared to launch them as soon as the Michigan Gaming Control Commission gives the green light.

"We want to offer our guests a complete casino experience, and that now includes sports betting," said Rodney Ferguson, CEO of the MGM Grand Detroit. "We've been planning and preparing for this opportunity for some time now, and we're excited to get started."

Sports betting is currently available in just a handful of states, including Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey and West Virginia. But it is expected to expand rapidly in the coming years now that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that it is a form of protected speech under the Constitution.

The court's decision cleared the way for individual states to legalize sports betting if they choose, and several – including New York, Pennsylvania and Illinois – are moving quickly to do so. In Michigan, lawmakers are currently considering bills that would allow sports betting in the state.

Casinos in Michigan are particularly well positioned to offer sports betting given the large number of professional sporting teams in the state. Detroit is home to teams in all four major North American professional sports leagues: baseball's Tigers, football's Lions, basketball's Pistons and hockey's Red Wings.
