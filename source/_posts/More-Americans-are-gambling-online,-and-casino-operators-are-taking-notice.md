#  More Americans are gambling online, and casino operators are taking notice

## The online gambling industry is booming, with more and more Americans placing bets on sporting events, casino games, and slots from the comfort of their own homes.

The growth of this industry can be attributed to a number of factors, including the convenience and accessibility of online gambling, the increasing availability of mobile devices and apps, and the relaxing of laws governing online gambling in some states.

Casino operators are taking notice of this trend, and are rushing to create their own online platforms and mobile apps to capitalize on the surging demand. In addition, they are also expanding their brick-and-mortar operations into new markets to capture a larger share of the pie.

This competitive environment is good news for consumers, as it has led to increased bonuses and promotions from casinos in an effort to attract new players. It has also led to better product offerings, with many casinos now offering a wide range of games, including live dealer options.

If you're thinking about giving online gambling a try, be sure to do your research first. There are a number of reputable online casinos that offer high-quality products and service. Be sure to read reviews from other players before making your decision.

#  Study Shows Online Wagering is on the Rise 

As technology continues to develop and new, innovative ways to gamble online come about, it seems that online wagering is only going to continue to grow in popularity. In fact, according to a recent study conducted by the online gambling research organization H2 Gambling Capital, online wagering is expected to increase by an impressive 7.5% globally in 2019. This growth is being driven largely by Asia’s increasing demand for online gambling options.

In 2017, global online wagering totaled $47.5 billion and is expected to grow to $51.5 billion by the end of 2019. The U.S., however, is actually seeing a slight decline in its share of the global market, going from a dominating 41% in 2017 down to 37% by the end of 2019. Europe, on the other hand, is projected to see a 5% growth in its share of the market. 

The study also found that there was a significant shift away from sports betting towards casino games such as blackjack and roulette, with these games now accounting for almost two-thirds of total global online wagers. Slot machines are also becoming increasingly popular, with their share of the market growing from 15% in 2017 to 19% by 2019. 

The growth of online wagering is not limited to just adults either - an estimated one-third of all online gamblers are now minors. With this in mind, it’s important for parents to be aware of the dangers that underage gambling can pose and take steps to protect their children from any potential harm. 

Overall, it’s evident that online gambling is continuing to grow in popularity around the world and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. So if you’re looking for a bit of excitement and want to try your luck at some exciting casino games or sports bets, be sure to check out one of the many reputable online gambling sites available today.

#  Australians Love Gambling at Online Casinos 

Australians are some of the most frequent gamblers in the world. In fact, a survey by gambling research company H2 Gambling Capital found that Australians lose more money per capita on gambling than any other nationality.

Much of this gambling takes place at online casinos. In a 2018 study, it was found that 87% of Australian adults had gambled at a casino in the past year, with over half (54%) of those having gambled online.

There are many reasons why Australians love to gamble at online casinos. Some of these include:

#  New Zealanders Favor Online Wagering Over Traditional Gambling

A recently released study conducted in New Zealand shows that online wagering is becoming increasingly popular among residents, while traditional gambling is losing its appeal.

The study, commissioned by the Latitude Research agency and carried out by Nielsen, looked at how different forms of gambling are viewed by the general population. It found that 83% of New Zealanders have gambled in some form or another in the past year, with most participating in lotteries (65%), scratch cards (57%) and casino games (47%). However, when it comes to the type of gambling that people prefer, online wagering came out on top.

When asked about their preferred form of gambling, 44% of participants said they would rather wager online than participate in any other type of activity. This was a significant increase from the 30% who said the same thing in a similar study conducted in 2014. In contrast, only 35% said they preferred to gamble at a physical casino, while just 26% liked playing lotteries and scratch cards.

What’s Behind Online Wagering’s Rise in Popularity?

So what’s behind the rise in popularity of online wagering? There are a few possible explanations.

For one thing, online wagering is becoming increasingly convenient and accessible. With more and more people using smartphones and other devices to access the internet, it’s easier than ever to place a bet or play a game from anywhere you happen to be. And thanks to the growing number of licensed offshore betting operators, there are now plenty of options when it comes to choosing an online site. This level of convenience is hard to beat.

Another factor that may be contributing to the rise in popularity of online wagering is the increasing availability of betting options across a wide range of sports and events. From horse racing and rugby matches to international soccer games and reality TV shows, there’s something for everyone when it comes to betting online. This broad range of choices may be appealing to some gamblers who want more flexibility and variety in their betting experience.

Finally, it’s worth noting that online wagering can often be more lucrative than other forms of gambling. Most sites offer competitive odds as well as generous bonuses and loyalty schemes, giving players the opportunity to make some serious profits if they hit a winning streak. This added incentive may be contributing to the rise in popularity of online wagering among Kiwis.
