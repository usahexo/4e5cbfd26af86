#  Exactly what is the reasoning behind the specific dates?

The dates of Thanksgiving in the United States are consistent yearly. They are always celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. Exactly what is the reasoning behind these specific dates?

There are a few explanations as to why Thanksgiving falls on the fourth Thursday of November each year. The first reason has to do with historical precedence. The Continental Congress declared the first national day of thanksgiving in 1777, and it was celebrated on November 26th. This date was specifically chosen because it coincided with the annual celebration of George Washington's birthday. In 1863, Abraham Lincoln declared that Thanksgiving would be commemorated annually on the last Thursday of November. This change was likely made to help with Union soldiers' preparation for the Christmas holiday.

In 1941, Franklin D. Roosevelt moved Thanksgiving up a week to help lengthen the economically struggling holiday shopping season. Some people argue that this was not actually an official change, but rather a presidential proclamation. Nevertheless, most Americans celebrate Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday of November regardless of whether or not it is an "official" holiday.

There are several reasons why some people might prefer to celebrate Thanksgiving on a different date than November 22nd or 29th. One reason is that these dates fall too close to the busy Christmas shopping season. Others might argue that celebrating at different times throughout the month could lead to more widespread celebrations and allow for more time with family and friends. What do you think about the reasoning behind America's traditional celebration of Thanksgiving?

#  How were the dates chosen?

There is no perfectly scientific or obvious answer to this question. In some cases, it may be simply a matter of convenience or tradition, while in others more significant factors such as astrology or numerology may be involved.

Some people might even believe that the date an event occurred can have a bearing on its outcome or significance. There are many who believe, for example, that the date a person is born can influence their character and life path.

There is plenty of debate surrounding the topic of choosing dates, with people having their own personal beliefs and preferences. What's important is that whichever date you choose, you feel confident and positive about it!

#  Who made the final decision on which dates are the best to go to the casino Chicago Cubs?

The Chicago Cubs are one of the most popular teams in all of sports, so it is no surprise that their games bring in a lot of revenue for the casino industry. But when it comes to deciding which dates are the best to go to the casino Chicago Cubs games, who makes the final decision?

There are a few different people who could be responsible for this decision. The first possibility is that the casino itself makes the call, looking at factors such as how many people have bought tickets and how much money they’re likely to make off of the game. However, it’s also possible that the team has a say in it as well. After all, the Cubs want as many people as possible in the seats to see their games, and having a good partnership with the casinos can only help them achieve that goal.

So who really makes the final decision? The answer is that it depends on who you ask. If you talk to someone from the casino industry, they will likely tell you that it’s up to them. However, if you talk to someone from the Cubs organization, they will probably say that it’s a joint decision between themselves and the casinos. In either case, though, it’s clear that both parties benefit from having each other involved.

So what makes a good date to go to a Cubs game at casino Chicago? Well, there are a few things that factor into this decision. First and foremost is obviously how well the team is doing. If they’re playing well and in contention for a playoff spot, then more people will be interested in coming out to see them play. In addition, there are also outside factors such as weather and competing events that can affect attendance.

All things considered, though, there are certain dates that are generally busier than others when it comes to casino Chicago Cubs games. For instance, weekends tend to be busier than weekday games, and games later in the season tend to be more popular than those earlier on. So if you want to try your luck at casino Chicago while catching a game at Wrigley Field, try and go during one of these times!
