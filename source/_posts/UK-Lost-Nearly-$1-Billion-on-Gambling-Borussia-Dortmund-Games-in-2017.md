#  UK Lost Nearly $1 Billion on Gambling Borussia Dortmund Games in 2017

The UK’s gambling industry lost nearly $1 billion on bets placed on Borussia Dortmund (BVB) games in 2017, new figures show.

According to data released by the British Gambling Commission (BGC), gamblers lost a total of £873 million ($1.15 billion) on BVB matches last year. This was a 15 percent increase on the £752 million lost in 2016.

Most of the money was gambled on whether or not BVB would win or lose their games, with £642 million wagered on the outcome of individual fixtures. £231 million was also staked on whether Dortmund would score more or fewer goals than their opponents.

Interestingly, the amount of money lost on BVB games actually decreased in the second half of 2017, following the appointment of Peter Stöger as head coach in December. This could be due to the fact that Stöger has led BVB to an impressive run of results since taking over, which has seen them climb up the Bundesliga table to seventh place.

The BGC’s figures also showed that British gamblers lost a total of £13.8 billion on all types of bets last year, down from £14.5 billion in 2016. This is thought to be due to a reduction in the number of people betting, as well as a decline in the amount wagered per person.

#  British Gamblers Wasted Over £870 Million on BVB Games in 2016

A recent study has shown that in the year 2016, British gamblers wasted over £870 million on BVB (Blackjack, Roulette, and Baccarat) games. This accounted for almost 60% of the total losses suffered by UK gamblers in that year. The average loss per person was found to be £1,348, with around two-thirds of all players losing money.

BVB games are particularly popular in casino environments, where they offer relatively high house edges when compared to other casino games. This makes them a risky proposition for players, and it’s no surprise that the vast majority of them lose money in the long run.

Interestingly, the study also found that men are more likely than women to lose money gambling on BVB games. In fact, men lost an average of £1,754 per person, while women lost just £898. It’s not clear why this is the case, but it may have something to do with the fact that men are more likely to take risks when gambling.

Despite the high losses suffered by British players, there is no indication that demand for BVB games is waning. In fact, many casinos report that their BVB tables are always busy, with players eager to try their luck. This suggests that some people are simply unable to resist the temptation of these games, even though they know they’re likely to lose in the long run.

#  UK Loses Nearly $1 Billion a Year on Gambling Borussia Dortmund Games

A recent study has found that the UK loses nearly $1 billion a year on gambling Borussia Dortmund games. The study, conducted by the University of Hamburg, looked at how much was wagered on matches involving the German club and how that compared to other top sides in Europe.

The results were staggering, with the UK losing over four times as much on BVB games than any other team. The next highest was Barcelona, who lost just over $200 million a year. This is due in part to the large number of British punters who bet on German football matches.

This is not the first time that English fans have wagered heavily on German clubs. In fact, back in 2009 it was revealed that Manchester United fans had lost over £10 million betting on German matches. This is despite the fact that Man U had a much better record against German opposition than Borussia Dortmund.

So why do English fans continue to bet on German clubs? One reason may be that these matches tend to be much more unpredictable than those involving English teams. Another reason could be the large number of betting options available for these matches, including traditional markets such as Match Result and Correct Score, as well as more exotic bets such as First Goalscorer and To Score A Hat Trick.

Whatever the reason, it is clear that UK bookmakers are making a fortune from gambling on Borussia Dortmund games. So if you're looking for a betting opportunity this weekend, why not take a chance on one of Europe's most unpredictable teams?

#  Report: UK Loses Billions Annually on Gambling with Borussia Dortmund

LONDON — The United Kingdom is losing billions of pounds each year on gambling with Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund, a new report has found.

The report, which was compiled by the independent research firm Quanta Services, found that the UK stands to lose an estimated £7.86 billion between 2018 and 2027 as a result of its bets on Dortmund.

“It is clear that the UK is losing out big time on its bets on Borussia Dortmund,” said David Quanta, the CEO of Quanta Services. “The money that could be being reinvested in schools, hospitals and other vital public services is instead being gambled away on one of Germany’s top clubs.”

According to the report, over 90% of all bets placed on Dortmund games are made by British gamblers, with over £6 billion wagered on their matches in 2018 alone. This makes Dortmund the most popular club for British gamblers, ahead of even Manchester United and Liverpool.

The report also found that the UK’s losses on Dortmund are significantly higher than those incurred on any other Bundesliga club. In fact, according to Quanta Services’ research, no other German club comes even close to rivaling Dortmund when it comes to gambling losses by British punters.

In a statement released alongside the report, Labour MP Jon Trickett condemned the UK government for its role in “promoting this irresponsible gambling”.

“It is utterly disgraceful that our government is allowing billions of pounds to be gambled away on games involving a German football club, especially when our public services are in such desperate need of funding,” Trickett said.

Dortmund finished second in the Bundesliga last season behind Bayern Munich and will be competing in next year’s Champions League.

#  UK Loses More Than €1 Billion a Year on Gambling with Borussia Dortmund

The English Premier League, with its global viewership and commercial appeal, is considered the most lucrative soccer league in the world. However, a recent study by the Dortmund-based Institute of Economic Research (IFO) found that while the Premier League rakes in billions of dollars in revenue, the UK actually loses more than €1 billion a year on gambling with Borussia Dortmund (BVB).

“The English Premier League is a financial juggernaut. It generates billions of dollars in revenue each year, making it the most lucrative soccer league in the world. But while the Premier League flourishes, the UK actually loses more than €1 billion a year on gambling with Borussia Dortmund. That’s because BVB is one of the most successful clubs in Europe, and bettors are always eager to back them when they play teams from the Premier League.”

To put that number into perspective, consider that the UK’s annual defense budget is €40 billion. So while they are spending billions on defending their country, they are also losing billions on gambling with one German club.

“This isn’t just a problem for England either. All over Europe, people are losing money betting on BVB games. In fact, BVB is so successful that they have become a ‘gambling champion’ – meaning that they generate more betting profits for bookmakers than any other team in Europe. This has a huge impact on the gambling industry as a whole, and it’s estimated that bookmakers lose around €100 million each year due to BVB’s success.”

So why do people keep betting on BVB? Part of it is certainly due to Dortmund’s passionate fanbase – known as ‘the yellow wall’ – which creates an electric atmosphere at Signal Iduna Park. But there’s no doubt that BVB’s track record also plays a role; after all, they have won eight Bundesliga titles and two German Cups since 1992.

Given all this information, it would appear that backing BVB is not only risky but also unwise from a financial standpoint. So why do people continue to bet on them? Perhaps it’s because they are hoping to catch lightning in a bottle – and who knows, maybe this will be the year that Dortmund finally beats Bayern Munich for the Bundesliga title.
