Alternatively, a company may have a large pool of customers or a dominant market share, which can be used to increase sales and revenue.

In terms of products and services, a company may offer a unique solution that no one else can match. It may also have a long history of providing high-quality goods or services that has earned it a loyal customer base. Additionally, if the company has a strong brand identity then it will be more likely to attract new customers and retain existing ones.

Finally, having a highly skilled and talented workforce is another major strength for any organisation. This includes areas such as R&D, marketing, and customer service. Employees who are passionate about their work and feel proud to be associated with the company will often go above and beyond to achieve success.
