#  What does Maupassant mean?

Maupassant is a French word that means "clipped". The word was created by writer Guy de Maupassant, who clipped his words together to create a new and unique form of writing. Maupassant was famous for his short stories, which were typically less than 1,000 words in length.

#  Who was Maupassant?

Maupassant is considered one of the fathers of the modern short story. He was born in France in 1850 and died in 1892. Maupassant is best known for his short stories, which are often dark, ironic, and satirical.

Maupassant was the son of a wealthy father who expected him to take up a career in law. However, Maupassant showed early signs of being a writer and persuaded his father to allow him to study literature instead. Maupassant first studied at the University of Heidelberg in Germany before transferring to Paris to continue his studies.

Maupassant had a difficult childhood, which was plagued by illness and family problems. These experiences would later influence his writing. Maupassant began writing professionally at the age of 19 and became a protégé of Flaubert, one of France’s most celebrated writers.

Maupassant is perhaps best known for his short story “The Necklace”, which was published in 1884. The story tells the tale of a young woman who borrows a expensive diamond necklace for a ball, only to lose it shortly afterwards. The woman then spends the next 10 years trying to pay off her debt.

Maupassant was an accomplished writer but also suffered from mental health issues throughout his life. He voluntarily committed himself to a mental hospital in 1892 where he later died from syphilis at the age of 42.
