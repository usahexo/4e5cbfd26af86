#  What is the Poisoned Apple Game?

The Poisoned Apple Game, also known as The Princess and the Pea, is a children's game that tests one's tactile abilities. The game is played with two or more players. One player is chosen to be the prince, and the others are princes or princesses. The prince lays down a number of bedding items (blankets, towels, sheets, etc.), and then hides a pea under one of them. The other players try to find the pea by feeling each of the bedding items.

The player who finds the pea is declared the princess, and must guess who hid it. If she guesses correctly, that player becomes the new prince; if she guesses incorrectly, she must take her place among the other players.
